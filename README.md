# Round_Robin_Two_Divisions

Currently this program is set to produce the schedule for 2 divisions
with a varying number of teams per divisions. The team names (home
bar) and team coaches are read in for easy reference in the schedule.

The output is some basic diagnostic output along with a text schedule
(e.g., 10 @ 2) that is designed to be compact. An alternate
presentation is given for a single team that shows just the schedule
for that team.

Future work:

1. Read in teams and coaches from an input file.

2. Output the schedule into Excel.

3. Create a customized calendar entry per team.
